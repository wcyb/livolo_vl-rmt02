# Livolo VL-RMT02
Reverse engineering of Livolo VL-RMT02, a RF remote used for controlling light switch.
In the "Description" folder, you can find a "How to" tutorial that shows how one can easily reverse engineer such RF remotes.

The "livolo_vl-rmt02" folder contains source code for Arduino that can be used to control light switch without using mentioned remote. You only need to have the cheapest RF module that you can get from AliExpress, that will be transmitting data on 433 MHz frequency.
